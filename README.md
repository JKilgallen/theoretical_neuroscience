# Theoretical Neuroscience

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of solutions to exercises from the book Theoretical Neuroscience (2005) by Peter Dayan and L. F. Abbott. 
These solutions will be provided in the form of jupyter notebooks which make use of tools provided by the python package [neural_code](https://github.com/JKilgallen/neural_code).
